This is the diagram class of the app:
![CurrencyList drawio](https://github.com/YuliantiOenang/CurrencyList/assets/3623363/b55c3fa4-84b6-4b73-8473-aab275412104)

Behaviour of the app

Consideration when making this app:
- The search will query throught the database to ensure it query the latest data
- The activity didn't hold the data, VM did, to ensure clean architecture (view only responsible to show the data) in this app

Let me know if you have any thought about it :)
